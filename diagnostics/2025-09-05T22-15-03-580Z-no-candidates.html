  <meta name="description" content="ABOUT RAMP

At Ramp, we’re rethinking how modern finance teams function in the age of AI. We believe AI isn’t just the next big wave. It’s the new foundation for how business gets done. We’re investing in that future — and in the people bold enough to build it.

Ramp is a financial operations platform designed to save companies time and money. Our all-in-one solution combines payments, corporate cards, vendor management, procurement, travel booking, and automated bookkeeping with built-in intelligence to maximize the impact of every dollar and hour spent. But we’re not just building features powered by AI. We’re building a platform where agents can chase receipts, close books, flag risks, and surface insights. This enables teams to reclaim their time and reinvest in what matters.

More than 40,000 businesses, from family-owned farms to space startups, have saved $10B and 27.5M hours with Ramp. Founded in 2019, Ramp powers the fastest-growing corporate card and bill payment platform in America, and enables over $80 billion in purchases each year.

Ramp’s investors include Thrive Capital, Sands Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Greylock, and Redpoint, among others, in addition to 100+ angel investors who have been founders or executives of leading companies.

Ramp has been named to Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies https://www.fastcompany.com/91038883/ramp-most-innovative-companies-2024 list and LinkedIn’s Top U.S. Startups https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2024-50-us-companies-rise-linkedin-news-hxote/?trackingId=uBI29YlAOxikbTI7cdvG4g%3D%3D for more than 3 years, as well as the Forbes Cloud 100 https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/08/06/ramp-cloud-100/, CNBC Disruptor 50 https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/ramp-cnbc-disruptor-50.html, and TIME Magazine’s 100 Most Influential Companies https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2023/6285147/ramp/.
